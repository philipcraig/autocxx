David Tolnay did much of the hard work here, by inventing the underlying cxx crate, and in fact nearly all of the parsing infrastructure on which this crate depends. `bindgen` is also awesome. This crate stands on the shoulders of giants!

Thanks to all the other contributors to cxx, bindgen and autocxx.
